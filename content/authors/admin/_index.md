Hola! I'm Sebastián, an Assistant Professor at the [Data & Artificial Intelligence Initiative](http://idia.uchile.cl) of Universidad de Chile, where I'm researching Knowledge Graphs: how to extract, manage and utilize them for better querying, browsing, and AI applications.
I am also a Collaborating Researcher at the [Institute for Foundational Research on Data](http://imfd.cl)
Previously, I worked at the Department of Computer Science at Universidad de Chile and earlier at Linköping University, Sweden.
I obtained my PhD from Universidad de Chile in 2021 with my thesis: Similarity-based Web Queries, 
proposing a self-similarity join algorithm and novel similarity join and clustering operators for SPARQL.
I'm part of the Editorial Board of the Open Access Journal [Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/tgdk).
