Hola! I'm Sebastián, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Computer Science of Universidad de Chile where 
I'm doing research on Graph Databases and Similarity-based applications.
Previously, I worked at Linköping University, Sweden, where I studied the interoperability among different graph database models.
I obtained my PhD from Universidad de Chile in 2021 with my thesis: Similarity-based Web Queries, 
proposing a self-similarity join algorithm and novel similarity join and clustering operators for SPARQL.
I really enjoy teaching; I'm currently lecturing the Algorithms and Data Structures course.
I'm part of the Editorial Board of the Open Access Journal [Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/tgdk).
