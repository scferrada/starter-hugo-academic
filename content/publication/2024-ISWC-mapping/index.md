abstract: This poster presents initial progress on a mapping to convert relational databases into knowledge graphs by utilizing the conceptual model of the database as a means of capturing its underlying semantics. We leverage the ERDoc language for defining Entity-Relationship Diagrams, for which we provide semantics. Unlike previous approaches, this method assumes the conceptual model as part of the input and emphasizes the formal definition, semantic correctness, and other properties of the mapping.
