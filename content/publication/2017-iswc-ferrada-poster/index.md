abstract: IMGpedia is a linked dataset that provides a public SPARQL endpoint
  where users can answer queries that combine the visual similarity of images
  from Wikimedia Commons and semantic information from existing knowledge-bases.
  Our demo will show example queries that capture the potential of the current
  data stored in IMGpedia. We also plan to discuss potential use-cases for the
  dataset and ways in which we can improve the quality of the information it
  captures and the expressiveness of its queries.
