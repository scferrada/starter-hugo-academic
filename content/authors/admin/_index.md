I'm Sebastián, an Assistant Professor at the [Data & Artificial Intelligence Initiative](http://idia.uchile.cl) of Universidad de Chile, where I research Knowledge Graphs — focusing on their extraction, management, and use for querying, browsing, and AI applications. I am also a Young Researcher at the Institute for Foundational Research on Data ([IMFD](http://imfd.cl)) and a Collaborating Researcher at the National Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (([CENIA](http://cenia.cl))).

Before joining the faculty, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Universidad de Chile and, earlier, at the Department of Computer and Information Science at Linköping University, Sweden. I obtained my PhD from Universidad de Chile in 2021 with a thesis on similarity-based web queries, where I proposed a self-similarity join algorithm and new similarity join and clustering operators for SPARQL. During my master's studies, I created [IMGpedia](http://imgpedia.dcc.uchile.cl), a large-scale multimedia knowledge graph that won first place in the Latin American Master Thesis Competition (CLEI 2017).

I serve on the Editorial Board of the Open Access Journal [Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/tgdk), and currently lead a Fondecyt project on graph data management. My work has been recognized with multiple awards, including Best Paper at CoopIS 2023 and both Best Student Paper (Resources Track) and Best Poster at ISWC 2017.
