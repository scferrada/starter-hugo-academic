Hola! I'm Sebastián, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Computer Science of Universidad de Chile. I'm doing research on Multimodal Knowledge Graphs and Federated Graph databases.
Previously, I worked at Linköping University, where I did research on the interoperability among different graph database models.
I obtained my PhD from Universidad de Chile in 2021 with my thesis: Similarity-based Web Queries, proposing a self-similarity join algorithm and a novel similarity join operator for SPARQL Databases.
I really enjoy teaching; I'm currently lecturing the Databases course and will lecture the Algorithms and Data Structures course next semester.
